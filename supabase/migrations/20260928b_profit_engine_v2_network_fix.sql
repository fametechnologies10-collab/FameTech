-- =============================================================================
-- Profit Engine v2 — AirtelTigo network-matching fix (controller-ruled
-- corrective fix discovered mid-implementation of Task 6, not in the
-- original 2026-09-28-profit-engine-v2 plan).
--
-- Bug: 20260928_profit_engine_v2.sql filters network with plain equality
-- (o.network = p_network / so.network = p_network / ao.network = p_network).
-- But `network` values are NOT uniform across the tables this feature reads:
--   - orders / shop_orders store AirtelTigo as TWO distinct values:
--     'AT-iShare' and 'AT-BigTime' (lib/utils.ts:29-37).
--   - airtime_orders stores AirtelTigo as a SINGLE unified value: 'AT'
--     (lib/ussd/handlers/airtime.ts:21).
--   - MTN and Telecel are consistent everywhere ('MTN', 'Telecel') — only
--     AirtelTigo has this split.
-- The UI (Task 6) correctly passes the literal string 'AirtelTigo' as
-- p_network. With plain equality, that string never matches any stored
-- value, so selecting "AirtelTigo" silently returned zero rows from every
-- category instead of the real number.
--
-- Fix: CREATE OR REPLACE both _profit_totals_v2 and _profit_daily_rows_v2
-- (already live on production) with a branching network predicate —
-- identical to the shipped SQL except the network-matching condition in
-- data_main, data_shop, and airtime_rows now special-cases p_network =
-- 'AirtelTigo' to match the real stored values. MTN/Telecel and the
-- unfiltered ('all'/NULL) path fall through to the original plain-equality
-- behavior, unchanged. Additive only — same function names, same
-- signatures, no caller changes needed (Task 3's route / Task 6's UI are
-- untouched).
